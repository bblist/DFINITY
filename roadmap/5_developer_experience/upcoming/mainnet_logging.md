Mainnet logging allows a developer to store and retrieve logs of canisters running on mainnet, either on the canister or the replica level, depending on the preferred detail level. It will also be possible to connect an external provider to a standards-compliant interface implemented by the replica, so a developer can get deeper insights into the behavior of their dapps.
