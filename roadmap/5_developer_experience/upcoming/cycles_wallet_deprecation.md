The cycles wallet has been a source of confusion for many newcomers. It is not a critical path for developing dapps on the Internet Computer, so we're removing it from dfx to make it simpler for developers to deploy code to mainnet. The Cycles Wallet project will still be actively maintained and developers can choose to install the wallet in their canisters.
