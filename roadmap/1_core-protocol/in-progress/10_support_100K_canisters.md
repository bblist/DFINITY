It has been observed that performance degrades (e.g. reduced finalization rate) when a subnet holds many canisters, but in the long term it should be able to support 100K+ canisters on a single subnet. This feature includes work around identifying and addressing the biggest bottlenecks when a subnet is running with many canisters in order to ensure a smooth operation even when many thousands of canisters exist on the same subnet.
