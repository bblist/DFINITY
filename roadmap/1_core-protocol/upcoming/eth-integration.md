Direct integration of the Internet Computer with the Ethereum blockchain will enable smart contracts on the Internet Computer to call smart contracts on Ethereum and vice versa in a trustless manner, without using any trusted intermediaries such as bridges. The integration will also include implementation of an Ethereum execution environment (EVM), which will enable the Internet Computer to run Solidity-/EVM-based smart contracts.
