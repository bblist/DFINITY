This feature enables canister smart contracts to have an ECDSA public key and to sign with regard to it. The corresponding secret key is threshold-shared among the nodes of a large subnet. Threshold ECDSA signatures are a prerequisite for the direct integration between the Internet Computer and Bitcoin, Ethereum, and possibly further ECDSA-based blockchains in the future.
