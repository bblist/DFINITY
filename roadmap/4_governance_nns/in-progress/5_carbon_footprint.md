This roadmap item is based on the community proposal 55487.

Step 1: Conduct a carbon footprint / environmental impact assessment - either through internal resources or hiring an external consultant to answer basic questions about what the carbon footprint of running an IC Subnet is, where that electricity is sourced, and what the total cost per transaction is on the IC blockchain. Based on the learnings define more activities. 

Step 2: “Energy consumption” reporting panel to the IC Network Status dashboard.
