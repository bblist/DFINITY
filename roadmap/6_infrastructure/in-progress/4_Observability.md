The replica and boundary nodes produce metrics and logs during their lifecycle. Based on these, problems are identified and issues debugged in testing and in production. Todayâ€™s monitoring solution has various limitations and shortcomings in terms of costs, openness and decentralization. We plan to specify and build a second-generation observability system that addresses shortcomings of the current system and prepares us for new challenges ahead. This new systems needs to take into account monitoring requirements on different levels of the IC: IC overall, Node level, dApp level, and dSRE level (data center and infrastructure).
